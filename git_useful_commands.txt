If the destination branch does not exist, you have to append the “-b” option, otherwise you won’t be able to switch to that branch.
$ git checkout <existing_branch>
$ git checkout -b <new_branch>

First, make sure that the target branch exists by running the “git branch” command.
$ git branch

Check if the file is present in the current branch or not in the local folder
$ git status

Next step is to add the file
$ git add filename.ext

Next step is to commit the file
$ git commit -m "commit comment"

Next step is to push the file to remote server, in that same branch whic you are currently in (e.g. master or develop or xyz)
$ git push origin branch_name
